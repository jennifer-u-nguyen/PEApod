# PEApod
High-altitude balloon capsule for analyzing stratospheric aerosols.

## Overview
The High-Altitude Particle Exposure Analysis (PEA) Device is a balloon-borne capsule designed to autonomously open in the stratosphere, expose a substrate to ambient aerosol particles, and reseal during descent for recovery. By enabling direct exposure to true stratospheric conditions, the device supports the collection and analysis of aerosols relevant to Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) research, specifically, particles with light-reflective properties that could reduce incoming solar radiation and mitigate aspects of global warming.

## What We Built
- Capsule body mechanical design
- Opening and closing mechanism
- Electrical subsystem integration
- Sample chamber pressurization system

## How It Works
(Simple explanation, diagrams encouraged.)

## Challenges & Tradeoffs
(What went wrong, constraints, iterations.)

## Results
(What worked, what didn’t, data if applicable.)

## Next Steps
(If you had more time, what you’d improve.)

## Credits
This project was developed in collaboration with the Keutsch Laboratory at Harvard University and the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA).
