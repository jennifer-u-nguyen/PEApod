# PEApod
High-altitude balloon capsule for analyzing stratospheric aerosols.

## Overview
The High-Altitude Particle Exposure Analysis (PEA) Device is a balloon-borne capsule designed to autonomously open in the stratosphere, expose a substrate to ambient aerosol particles, and reseal during descent for recovery. By enabling direct exposure to true stratospheric conditions, the device supports the collection and analysis of aerosols relevant to Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) research, specifically, particles with light-reflective properties that could reduce incoming solar radiation and mitigate aspects of global warming.
